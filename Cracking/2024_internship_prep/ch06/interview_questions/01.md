# Question : The Heavy Pill
You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once. 

* Sol
  1. Number bottles from 1 to 20.
  2. Then, for the i-th bottle, put (10)^(i-1) pills on the scale.
  3. Get the weight from the scale.
  4. If the result contains 0.1 then the first bottle has 1.1 gram pills.
  5. Else, check where 2 is at. If 2 is at j-th digit starting from the least significant digit, (j+1)-th bottle will have 1.1 gram pills.

* Test with code
  ```python
  def get_unique_bottle(bottles: list) -> int:
    weight = 0
    power = 1
    for i in range(len(bottles)):
        weight += bottles[i] * power
        power *= 10
    
    if weight - int(weight) > 0:
        return 1
    else:
        cnt = 2
        int_weight = int(weight)
        while int_weight > 0:
            if int_weight % 10 == 2:
                return cnt
            else:
                int_weight //= 10
                cnt += 1

    return None

  if __name__ == '__main__':
    B = [1.0] * 20
    for i in range(20):
        B[i] = 1.1
        print(f"answer : {i+1}, result : {get_unique_bottle(B)}")
        B[i] = 1.0
  ```
